Jari & Taika is finnish light music orchestra. Developing and creating web site for this band was an assignment in web development module at my first year of ICT studies at Häme University of Applied Sciences. Web site is developed in finnish language.

## Assignment

Create a high quality and elegant web page for Jari & Taika band using given images and information. There is also some wishes from customer that you should consider. Use your creativity and own visions in this work. There is four week time limit. The web site should be build using HTML5 and CSS3. JavaScript must be used at least in one site. There must be some possibility to listen music samples (e.g. link to Spotify) and there shoud be some example of bands repertoire. The web site should contain image callery and link to facebook page. There should also be a place for contact info or other way to get in touch.


## My ideas
When I was familiarizing my self to the band and given materials, I noticed that the band had lots of stuff here and there. I wanted to make a website where there is all information, images and interesting articles at the same place. When I googled the band (that I have never heard of before) I suprised when noticing that they had done tours overseas and even been nominated in Eurovisions! I gathered all these big news at the front page and linked them to the original writings.  

From YouTube I found some gig recordings and interwievs that located in several different accounts. I gathered also all videos that I found and linked them to the web site. I spend maybe too much time figuring out all the past gigs and listed them (that information was not given in assignment materials) and also saved all different imagas that I found in bands own social media accounts. There were only couple not so great quality images in given materials.  

So I had quite a lot material to place in the website. In addition to all this there were bands repertoire, history, albums and presentations and lot more contet that I tried to place nicely to the web site.

## What did I learn?
I wanted to challenge my self little bit and I created the web site using Bootstrap. This was my first time using Bootstrap so it took me most of the given time just learn how to do things. But after figuring out the ideology behind Bootstrap I managed to complete the assingment in given time period. I feel I learnd the fundamentals of Bootstrap very well and understood it's popularity among web developers.  

On the other hand, because of learning Bootstrap I didin't have that much time for learning JavaScript. Javascript is used only in image gallery where images are opening in lightboxes. Also when user hovers a mouse in top of a thumbnail image, it turns black and white and increases a little. This project gave a little taste of JavaScript, but there so much more to explore.

## Improve
After gathering and placing all the possible information about the band, I just realized that there is too much staff and the web site is kind a heavy looking. Especially sites "Ohjelmisto" (repertoire) and video section in "Tapahtumat" site is kind of messy. Also the text in jumbotron below the band logo does not stand out very well.  

I also had in mind that the jumbotron and footer should stay in a place, not reload every time user changes page. Same issue is with the music player placed in jumbotorn. If user has a song playing in there, it changes or reload every time the page changes. I think that if I'd had time to learn more javascript, the solution would maybe found in there.
